SciteProj
---------

SciteProj is a Project Manager for usage with the SciTE text editor.
It is based on ScitePM by Roy Wood. It is a "director" of SciTE, using
it's director interface to communicate between SciteProj and SciTE. See 

http://www.scintilla.org/SciTEDirector.html

for more information. SciteProj saves the project file to disk in XML format.


Running:
--------

SciteProj will load a configuration from the file ~/.sciteproj each program
start - If no such file exists one will be created. The options availible in
there are:

* The window geometry

You can enter wanted window geometry/positioning, which will be applied to 
the program upon next program start. The variable are xpos, ypos, width and
height.

Also, the following options exist:

* give_scite_focus
	If this is set to TRUE, the SciTE window will recieve focus when you open
	a file from SciteProj. (Defaults to FALSE)

* dirty_on_folder_change
	Should the project be marked as "dirty" when expanding or collapsing a 
	folder? (Defaults to FALSE)

* allow_duplicates
	Specifies wether the user shall be able to add a file that has a name that 
	is the same as a file already included in the project? (Defaults to TRUE)

* identify_sciteproj_xml
	Specifies wether SciteProj shall try to identify the XML as saved by 
	SciteProj? (Defaults to TRUE)

You can open this configuration file by opening the Edit menu and select Edit 
Options in that menu. This will open ($HOME)/.sciteproj as if it was part of 
your project and edit it in SciTE.

SciteProj will give you a warning if it isn't able to find the SciTE 
executable on SciteProj start. As default SciTE will be searched for in 
/usr/bin, /bin, and /usr/local/bin, under the names scite and SciTE. If it 
isn't found there you will get a warning upon running. You can also use the 
--scite flag when running to locate SciTE, for example 

sciteproj --scite=/bin/scite 

will look for the scite executable in the /bin/ folder. SciTE will also be
searched for in the path pointed to by the environment variable SciTE_HOME.

You will need to save a project before adding to it - this is because SciteProj
saves the XML containing relative paths, relative to the postition your project
file is located in.

SciteProj is able to generate a project file through the --generate option - 
using a command line like

sciteproj --generate test.xml 7

will create a SciteProj project file named test.xml, containing all the folders
and files in the current dir, and 7 folder underneath in the directory 
structure. If the depth is left out, SciteProj will default to a maximum depth
of 4 folders.

By pressing Ctrl+R or choosing "View Recently Opened Files" in the "View" menu,
you split up the project window in two parts, and the new part contain a list
of the most recently opened files in the project. The files in this list are 
sorted so the ones you opened latest is at the top of the list.
