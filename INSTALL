Installation:
-------------

To build, first check that you have the packages required. The ones required 
to build are:

libgtk2.0-dev

Then create a folder (if there isn't one already) to build in. 

	$ mkdir build
	$ cd build
	
There you just run the cmake command, pointing it to the folder with the 
CMakeLists.txt file, which should be the one above, and tell it that it
should generate Unix Makefiles.

	$ cmake .. -G"Unix Makefiles"

(On a linux system there is a chance that the -G"Unix Makefiles" is implied
by default, and thus not necessary.) This will find necessary GTK libraries, 
and generate makefiles. If you would like to build a debug version of the 
program, you should enter 

	$ cmake .. -DDEBUG=on

Which will make the resulting executable contain debug flags for easy usage
with for example gdb. It will also #define _DEBUG, which is used in the source
for debug specific code.

When this is done (for either the debug or release version) you can simply 
enter 

	$ make

and the program will be built. If you would like to see the full commands
including all options that are run during the compile, you can add VERBOSE=1 
to the make command. Then, to install run make install with superuser rights:

	$ su -c "make install"
	
or on a system using sudo:

	$ sudo make install

This installs a desktop file too, so now you should have an icon in the 
development part of your X menu.
Now you are ready to run the program!
