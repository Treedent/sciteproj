Installation:
-------------

To build, first check that you have the packages required. The ones required 
to build are:

libgtk2.0-dev

Then the build process is simple - to build the program, just type

make

which will in the end create an executable in the bin folder. If you want to
build an executable with debug symbols enable, run

make DEBUG=1

The makefile makes it possible to build with flags to turn on warnings for
non-GTK3 compatible symbols, to enable this, run

make CHECK_GTK3=1

and also flags for other checks for deprecated symbols 

make CHECK_DEPRECATED=1

(this is also enabled by the CHECK_GTK3 flag).
To install the program run

make install

with super user priviliges, on a system using root:

su -c "make install"

or on a system using sudo, run

sudo make install

This will install the program in the system. This installs a desktop file too, 
so now you should have an icon in the development part of your X menu.
