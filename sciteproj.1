.SH CONFIG FILE
The config file that SciteProj is using is named sciteprojrc, and is loaded from 
the directory that the glib function g_get_user_config_dir is returning. 
Normally this is ($HOME)/.config/ - If this file isn't found, sciteproj searches
for the file .sciteproj located in the users $HOME directory. It is loaded on 
every program start. There is a menuitem in the program to open the file 
directly in SciTE for editing. 
If there isn't a .sciteproj in the user home when starting SciteProj, 
one will be created filled with default values.
The following options are supported in the config file:
.IP "xpos, ypos, xsize and ysize"
